# Setup

Before we dive into the project, let's make sure you've got all you'll need.

1. A code editor. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though you can use whatever you're comfortable with.
2. A command line. I work on Mac OS/Linux, so instructions will be in bash. I recommend [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you're on a Windows so you can still use Linux commands. That said, you can use native windows if you choose, you may just have to convert some commands.
3. The latest [Go toolchain installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).
4. A REST client to test HTTP requests with. I use the [REST client VS code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client), but you can use [curl](https://curl.se/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or whatever you prefer.
