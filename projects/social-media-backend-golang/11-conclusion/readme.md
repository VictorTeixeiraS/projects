# Submit the link to your repository!

If you haven't been keeping track of your project in Git, you should be! Once you have your finished project on Github or another source control platform, submit the link to your project above! Your link should look something like `https://github.com/gihub-username/repo-name`.

I hope you've enjoyed the project, it's always good to solidify the things you learn in courses by getting your hands dirty with a real project.
## Ideas for extending the project

* Use SQLite or PostgresQL instead of a JSON file for your database layer
* Let users save other data with their posts, maybe an image URL?
* Add proper authentication to each request, you could even use my [password validator](https://github.com/wagslane/go-password-validator)
* Add more unit tests!
* Deploy your api on AWS, GCP, or Digital Ocean
* Dockerize it
* Add documentation using markdown files
* Write a client that interacts with the API, maybe a webpage or a mobile app
