# Setup

Before we dive into the project, let's make sure you've got all you'll need.

1. A code editor. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though you can use whatever you're comfortable with.
2. A command line. I work on Mac OS/Linux, so instructions will be in Bash. I recommend [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you're on Windows so you can still use Linux commands. That said, you can use native Windows if you choose, you may just have to convert some commands on your own.
3. The latest [Go toolchain installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).
4. A REST client to test HTTP requests with. I recommend using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or the [Thunder Client for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client). Try them and use whatever you prefer.
