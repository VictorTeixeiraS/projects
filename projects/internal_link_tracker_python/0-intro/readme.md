# Internal Link Tracker in Python

It's time to put your Python skills to the test and build a real project on your local computer. By the end of this project, you'll have an "internal link tracker" that will allow your users to analyze the internal linking profile of a website for SEO purposes. You'll also be able to show off this project on your Github profile and your resume, so do your best work!

## A note from Lane

Thanks for joining me in this link tracker project! I've been writing Python for over 10 years, and it is such a great fit for a small productivity script like this. Backlinks are the back-bone of SEO on websites around the world, and frequently website owners want to know how well the pages on their site link to the other pages. A healthy amount of backlinks makes your website easy to navigate for the user as well as Google's crawler bot. Our tool will be a command-line script that prints the backlink profile of a website.

If you get stuck or have questions, I hang out in [Qvault's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/EEkFwbv), and someone from the community or myself would love to answer your questions and get to know you better.

## Projects vs Courses

Projects are our way of providing "unguided" learning. Courses are a great way to learn new concepts quickly, then projects let you get your hands dirty with "real world" code.

* In a project you work on your local machine
* You'll have a working codebase at the end to show off on your Github profile or on a resume
* Projects allow you to come up with more of the solution on your own, like you would in a real life job
* You'll still have instructions and guidance on how to complete each step
