## Projects vs Courses

Projects are Qvault's way of providing "unguided" learning to students. Courses are a great way to learn new concepts quickly, then projects let you get your hands dirty with "real world" code.

* In a project you work on your local machine
* You'll have a working codebase at the end to show off on your Github profile or on a resume
* Projects allow you to come up with more of the solution on your own, like you would in a real life job
* You'll still have instructions and guidance on how to complete each step

## A note from Lane

I'm glad to have you with me in this HTTP server project! I've been writing Go for over 5 years, and it is by far my favorite general purpose programming language. I've found it has positioned itself well as a fast, simple, and lightweight language that I think will become the backbone of the modern web.

If you get stuck or have questions, I hang out in [Qvault's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/EEkFwbv), and someone from the community or myself would love to answer your questions and get to know you better. Also, feel free to reach out directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wagslane).
