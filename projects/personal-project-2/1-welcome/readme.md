# Welcome

Welcome to your second personal project! By the end, you'll have something to show off on your resume and Github profile. It will stand as proof that you know how to build a working project.

## Setup

Make sure you have:

1. A code editor. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though you can use whatever you're comfortable with.
2. A command line. Linux and MacOS default to Bash-like command line interpreters, which is great. I recommend [WSL 2 with Ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you're on Windows so you can practice Bash.
3. A Github or Gitlab account where you'll store your project.

## Google is your friend!

Do not be afraid to use the internet to find help with this project. This is an *on-your-own* project, which means you will be expected to do almost everything by yourself.

Look up documentation as you need it. This is good practice for what it's like to work in a real dev job.

If you do get stuck, you can always reach out for help in the Boot.dev Discord community.
