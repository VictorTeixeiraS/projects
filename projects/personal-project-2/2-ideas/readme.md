# Once you have your idea, get started

You're building *your own idea* in this project, so try to think of something that's fun and interesting for you! You'll be asked to submit a link to your finished project's Github in the next step.

## Tips

* Plan on spending around 20 hours on this project.
* Use a programming language you're already familiar with.
* Feel free to incorporate libraries or frameworks that you find interesting.
* Commit your code to Git often, and push it up to Github or Gitlab.
* Create a `Readme.md` file in Markdown for your project. It should explain to readers:
  * What the purpose of the project is
  * How to download and run it
* Write clean and understandable code
* If you get stuck, ask for help in the Discord or on a related Subreddit

## Potential project ideas

You can build whatever you want, but here are some ideas to spark your creativity.

### Applications

* A website using Go HTML templates
* A backend server for a specific type of webapp
* A filesystem or disk manager. Stats about your filesystem
* A backend server for managing live chat with websockets
* A product scraper for Ebay or Amazon
* A time tracker
* Your own static code analysis tool (e.g. staticcheck)
* File compressor, e.g. Zip
* A CLI tool to download all the images from a webpage and optimize them for SEO
* Your own ETL service (logstash alternative)

### Libraries

* A password strength detector
* A "batteries included" client for your favorite technology, like RabbitMQ, Kafka, Postgres, or MySQL
* A markdown parser
* A logging package, with log levels and different output formats (stdout, HTTP, etc)
* An HTML parser
* A library that generates fake data. For example, give me 10,000 random strings for testing.
* An SPI library for a Raspberry Pi
* An opinionated unit testing library
