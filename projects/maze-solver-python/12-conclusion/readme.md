# Submit the link to your repository above!

If you haven't been keeping track of your project in Git, you should be! Once you have your finished project on Github or another source control platform, submit the link to your project above! Your link should look something like `https://github.com/gihub-username/repo-name`.

I hope you've enjoyed the project, it's always good to solidify the things you learn in courses by getting your hands dirty with a real project.

## Ideas for extending the project

* Add other solving algorithms, like breadth first search or A*
* Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
* Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
* Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
* Make much larger mazes to solve
* Make it a game where there use chooses directions
* If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
* Make it 3 dimensional
* Time the various algorithms, see which ones are fastest
