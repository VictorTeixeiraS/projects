# Reset the cell's "visited" property

Write a `_reset_cells_visted` method. It should simply reset the `visited` property of all the cells in the `Maze` to `False`. Call it after `_break_walls_r` so we can reuse the `visited` property when solving the maze in the next step.

Write a unit test for your method.
