# Setup

Before we dive into the project, let's make sure you are all set up properly. You will need:

1. A code editor. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though you can use whatever you're comfortable with.
2. A command line. I work on Mac OS/Linux, so instructions will be in Bash. I recommend [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you're on Windows because it will allow you to use Linux commands. That said, you can use native Windows if you choose, you may just have to convert some commands on your own.
3. [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
4. You shouldn't need to install any dependencies for this, the graphical [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) package we'll be using comes bundled with Python 3.

## Google is your friend!

Do not be afraid to use the internet to find help with this project. This is a *semi-guided* project, which means you will be expected to figure some things out on your own, and look up some documentation as you need it. This is good practice for what it's like to work in a real developer job.
