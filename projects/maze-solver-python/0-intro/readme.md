# Maze Solver in Python

It's time to put your algorithms skills to the test and build and visualize your newfound knowledge by building a maze solver. By the end of this project, you'll have a program that can generate a maze visually and solve it. You'll also be able to show off this project on your Github profile and your resume, so do your best work!

## A note from Lane

Thanks for joining me in this maze solve project! I've been writing Python for over 10 years, and it is such a great fit for a small app like this. Path-finding algorithms can be hard to understand if you only interact with them through the command line and console output. I think it's really fun to build a graphical app so we can visualize them!

## Projects vs Courses

Projects are our way of providing "unguided" learning. Courses are a great way to learn new concepts quickly, then projects let you get your hands dirty with "real world" code.

* In a project you work on your local machine
* You'll have a working codebase at the end to show off on your Github profile or on a resume
* Projects allow you to come up with more of the solution on your own, like you would in a real life job
* You'll still have instructions and guidance on how to complete each step
