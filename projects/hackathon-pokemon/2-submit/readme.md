# Once you've double checked all the instructions below, submit your project using the link above

## Link submission format

Your link should be the link to your Github repo. It should look something like:

> https://github.com/gihub-username/repo-name

But where `gihub-username` is *your* username and `repo-name` is *your* repo name.

## Make sure you've synced your Discord and Boot.dev accounts BEFORE you submit your link

You can test that you are synced by running the `/profile` slash command in the [#bot-cli](https://discord.com/channels/551921866173054977/921896108853178398) channel in Discord.

## Make sure the category you belong to is in your Readme!!!

Somewhere near the top of your Readme indicate whether you're a "junior" or "senior" and estimate how long you've been writing code:

```markdown
# My Awesome project

...

## Category: senior

I've been writing code for about 18 months

## Quick start

...
```

If you forget to include this you won't be judged.

## Test your project one last time!

Follow the setup instructions you wrote in the `Readme.md` so you can *be 100% sure they work*. Make sure to start from *zero*. Clone the project down into a new location on your computer and test there.

## You only get one chance to submit your link

Do NOT submit your link multiple times, it will make judging difficult and disqualify you. Once you submit, you should see the link to your repo in Discord in the [#i-made-this channel](https://discord.com/channels/551921866173054977/817028206002831360). If you don't see it there, please report it in the Discord.

## You can edit your repo up until the deadline at 5PM on Friday

You can continue pushing changes to your repo up until 5PM on Friday (MST), but if there are any commits *after* the deadline you'll be disqualified.

## Don't forget to come to the wrap-up event in Discord to see if you won!

The wrap up event where we award the winners with prizes will be at 11AM MST on Saturday in the Discord. Here's the [link to the event](https://discord.gg/7yQk62cZG9?event=1007370533014343801).
