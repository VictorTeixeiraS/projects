# GitHub Repository

*If you already know how to set up GitHub or Gitlab repos, you can skip this step*

Developers keep their coding projects in [repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories). [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular website for storing repositories online. GitHub serves several purposes:

* As a backup of all your code on the cloud in case something happens to your computer
* As a central place to share your code and collaborate on it with others
* As a public portfolio for your coding projects

## Git != GitHub

It's important to understand that Git and GitHub are *not the same*! Git is an open-source tool that you use to manage repositories. In the next step we will talk more about Git. GitHub and it's primary competitors GitLab and BitBucket are commercial software products that *use* Git. Their websites give us a way to store our code that's managed by Git.

## Create a GitHub Account

IF you don't have a GitHub account yet, create one [here](https://github.com/). You will likely use this account *heavily* for the rest of your career as a developer, so add a good profile picture and use a sensible username.

## Create a GitHub repository for this project

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to create a new repo, and call it `bookbot`. Make sure that:

* The repo is public
* You check the box to "initialize the repo with a README" 

Once the repo is created and it has a README inside, *move on to the next step.*
