# Count Letters

Add a new function to your script that takes the text from the book as a string, and returns the number of times each character appears in the string. Convert any uppercase letters to lowercase letters, we don't want duplicates.

## Hints

I'd recommend using a dictionary of `String` -> `Integer`.

When you print out the dictionary it should look something like this:

```
{'p': 6121, 'r': 20818, 'o': 25225, ...
```

To convert a string to lowercase:

```py
"SomeText".lower()
# "sometext"
```
