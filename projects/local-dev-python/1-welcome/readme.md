# Welcome

Welcome to your first project! We're going to build "Book Bot" - a Python program that can analyze an entire book's text and print out an interesting statistical report.

By the end of the project you'll have something to show off on your resume and Github profile. It will stand as proof that you know how to build a working project *on your own computer*.

## If you get stuck, you have support on Discord

It's *totally normal* to get stuck. When you do, first spend a few minutes searching online for answers. Try to use search terms that are *very specific* to the problem you're running into. If you still can't find an answer, hop in to the [Boot.dev Discord](https://discord.gg/EEkFwbv) and ask your question there. Again, try to be *super specific* about how what you're stuck on so we can help you as quick and efficiently as possible!

## Getting your local development environment configured

In this project, rather than writing code in your browser, you'll be building a project on your own machine - just like you would in a real job.

We're going to spend the first few of steps of this project ensuring that you have a simple (but professional-quality) development environment installed and working on your computer.

**When you're ready to start, mark that you are "done with this step" and move on to the next one.**
