# Running Python

Let's run some Python code! Create a new file called `main.py`. You can use the VS Code file explorer or run the command:

```bash
touch main.py
```

Open the file in the file explorer and paste in some simple "hello world" code.

```python
print("hello world")
```

Run your program:

```bash
python main.py
```

If it printed "hello world" to the console, pat yourself on the back! You've got a professional Python development environment configured that will serve you well for years to come.

*You can move to the next step.*
