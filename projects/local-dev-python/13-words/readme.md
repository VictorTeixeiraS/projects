# Count words

Add a new function to your script that takes the text from the book as a string, and returns the number of words.

Use a `print()` statement to make sure your function works. For the frankenstein book, you should get `77986` words!

## Hint

In Python you can split a string on whitespace using the [.split() method](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=split#str.split).

```py
words = s.split()
```
