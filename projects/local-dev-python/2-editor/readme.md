# Choosing an Editor

*If you already have a code editor you prefer, you can skip this step. Otherwise, read on and we'll set you up with VS Code.*

Up to this point, you've written code in our in-browser editor. The in-browser editor is great for learning concepts, but in order to get practice with how you'll build projects at a real job you'll need to install your own editor on your computer.

The benefit of coding on your own machine in the long-term is that you get to configure your experience the way you like it. The downside in the short-term is you need to spend some time configuring it.

## Installing VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (not to be confused with Visual Studio) is the [most popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment) code editor among developers today, and for good reason! We love it because it:

* Is easy to use for beginners
* Is powerful enough for professionals
* Is flexible through a marketplace of plugins
* Has out-of-the-box support for practically every popular coding language

[Install VS Code on your machine here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to complete this step.
