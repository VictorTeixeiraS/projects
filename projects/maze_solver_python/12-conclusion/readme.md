# Thanks for joining me!

I hope you've enjoyed the project, it's always good to solidify the things you learn in courses by getting your hands dirty with a real project. Remember to add this project to your Github profile, it can be useful as proof-of-knowledge in interviews and on your resume.

## Ideas for extending the project

* Add other solving algorithms, like breadth first search or A*
* Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
* Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
* Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs
* Make much larger mazes to solve
* Allow a user to choose the directions to go next, make it a game
* Make it 3 dimensional
