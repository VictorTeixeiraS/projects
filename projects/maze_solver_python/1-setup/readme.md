# Setup

Before we dive into the project, let's make sure you are all set up properly. You will need:

1. A code editor. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though you can use whatever you're comfortable with.
2. A command line. I work on Mac OS/Linux, so instructions will be in bash. I recommend [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you're on Windows so you can still use Linux commands. That said, you can use native windows if you choose, you may just have to convert some commands on your own.
3. [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
4. I recommend using a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to keep track of dependencies, it's a great way to separate the various packages you use on different projects so they don't get in the way of each other. You can create a new virtual env called `venv` by typing `python3 -m venv venv`, then you can "enter" the virtual environment by typing `source venv/bin/activate`.
