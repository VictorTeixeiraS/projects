# Once you have your idea, get started

You're building *your own idea* in this project, so try to think of something that's fun and interesting for you! You'll be asked to submit a link to your finished project's Github in the next step.

## Tips

* Plan on spending **40+ hours on this project**.
* Use a programming language you're already familiar with.
* Feel free to incorporate libraries or frameworks that you find interesting.
* Commit your code to Git often, and push it up to Github or Gitlab.
* Create a `Readme.md` file in Markdown for your project. It should explain to readers:
  * What the purpose of the project is
  * How to download and run it
* Write clean and understandable code
* If you get stuck, ask for help in the Discord or on a related Subreddit

## Potential project ideas

You can build whatever you want. I don't want to give you any ideas for this one, I really want you to spend some time and think about what you think would be fun and interesting to spend some serious time on.

Feel free to look for ideas online!
