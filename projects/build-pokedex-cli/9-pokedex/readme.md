# Pokedex

Add the `pokedex` command. It takes no arguments but should print a list of all the names of the Pokemon the user has caught.

## Example usage

```bash
Pokedex > catch pidgey
Throwing a Pokeball at pidgey...
pidgey was caught!
You may now inspect it with the inspect command.
Pokedex > catch caterpie
Throwing a Pokeball at caterpie...
caterpie was caught!
You may now inspect it with the inspect command.
Pokedex > pokedex
Your Pokedex:
 - pidgey
 - caterpie
```
