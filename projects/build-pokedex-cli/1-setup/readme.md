# Welcome

## What are we building?

We're going to build a Pokedex in a command-line [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). We'll use the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to power all of the data we'll need. If you're not familiar with Pokemon, or a Pokedex, that's okay! A Pokedex is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats.

### The learning goals

* Learn how to [parse JSON in Go](https://blog.boot.dev/golang/json-golang/)
* Practice making HTTP requests in Go
* Learn how to build a CLI tool that makes interacting with a back-end server easier
* Get hands-on practice with local Go development and tooling
* Learn about caching and how to use it to improve performance

## Setup

Before we dive into the project, let's make sure you have everything you'll need on your machine.

1. A code editor. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though you can use whatever you're comfortable with.
2. A command line. I work on Mac OS/Linux, so instructions will be in Bash. I recommend [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you're on Windows so you can still use Linux commands. That said, you can use native Windows if you choose, you may just have to figure out some of the commands on your own.
3. The latest [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install).
4. If you're in VS Code, I recommend installing the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go). It's not required, but it makes working with Go a lot easier.
5. Also, in VS Code, I recommend setting up "format on save". This will automatically format your code when you save it. Poke through the Go extension settings to look at some of the options and make sure you're happy with your tooling!

If you're ready, move on to the next step!
